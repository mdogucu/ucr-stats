## Abstract

Many data scientists are not trained in Bayesian Statistics. Those who are trained, are often introduced to Bayesian statistics as part of their graduate studies. During this talk, I will discuss the importance of Bayesian statistics for undergraduate learners. I will share an outline of an undergraduate Bayesian course and examples from the open-access “Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Bayesian Modeling with R” book. I will provide insights about computational aspects of teaching Bayesian statistics and include examples from the {rstan} and {rstanarm} as well as the {bayesrules} package - a pedagogical package that supplements the Bayes Rules! book.
